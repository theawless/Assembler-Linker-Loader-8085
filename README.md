# PALLS-8085
A basic implementation of pre-processor, assembler, linker, loader and simulator for a subset of C language.

Converts from a subset of C language to 8085 assembly language. Supports global variables, multiple files and macros.

The assembly happens in two passes and you can see the output of these passes too.

## Dependencies
* GTK+3
* Python3

## Usage
* Pre-processing > assembly > linking > loading > simulating.

The application is pretty straight forward, click on whichever feature you want but in above order.

Pre processing is done automatically. For simulating you need to click multiple times.
